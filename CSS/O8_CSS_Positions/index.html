<!--So why do we need position.? what is a position in css-->
<!--We need to know about positions when we need to move a html element to a new position (assign a new position)-->


<!--static position-->
<!--This is the default position that we have for elements-->
<!--this static position is defined by based on the element type-->
<!--Inline and Block level elements-->

<!--Relative Position-->
<!--If some-one wants to move an element left,right,top,bottom from where it was positioned without breaking the current flow of the structure
then we can use this relative positioning-->

<!--Absolute Position-->
<!--So if someone wants to move an element or positioned a child in relate with its one of the parents then this
absolute positioning can be used-->
<!--In here we need to remember by applying relative it will remove that element from the normal flow of the document,
which means it will change the normal flow-->
<!--Secondly we should remember after applying left,right,top and bottom properties to the absolute element
we need to have a non-static positioned parent-->
<!--Otherwise it will use the viewport to make its position-->

<!--Fixed Position-->
<!--Will behave same as the absolute positioning, but it will be positioned
according to the viewport and it will be fixed and will not move with
the normal content-->

<!--Sticky Position-->
<!--Mix version of relative and fixed positions. will maintain a fixed position
in a container until its parent scroll point is over-->
